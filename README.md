# Ai-biases-Ofqual-algorithm-

# I) Intrododuction: 

- problem statement 

- aim of our study 

- hypotheses

a) The Ofqual algorithm tends to predict higher grades for private school students than for state school students, regardless of these students' personal historical performance track record.

b)The Ofqual algorithm tends to skew its predicted grades upwards and downwards, hollowing out the middle of the grade distribution. (This is practically what Haines found, we could just argue here that we wanted to replicate this, see if it works for us as well).

# n is the number of pupils in the subject being assessed
# k is a specific grade
# j indicates the school
# C[k,j] is the historical grade distribution of grade at the school (centre) over the last three years, 2017-19.
# q[k,j] is the predicted grade distribution based on the classâ€™s prior attainment at GCSEs. A class with mostly 9s (the top grade) at GCSE will get a lot of predicted A*s; a class with mostly 1s at GCSEs will get a lot of predicted Us.
# p[k,j] is the predicted grade distribution of the previous years, based on their GCSEs. You need to know that because, if previous years were predicted to do poorly and did well, then this year might do the same.
# r[j] is the fraction of pupils in the class where historical data is available. If you can perfectly track down every GCSE result, then it is 1; if you cannot track down any, it is 0.
# CAG is the centre assessed grade.
# P[k,j] is the result, which is the grade distribution for each grade k at each school j.

# III) Overall Results:


> Prediction error 

A* private: 1.45% state: 0.36%
A private: 3.69% state: 1.43%
B private: 2.17% state: 2.90%
C private: -3.36% state: 0.67%
D private: -3.19% state: -3.05%
E private: -1.03% state: -2.04%
F private: -0.26% state: -0.54%

> Missing data (private schools) 28.54%

> Missing data (state schools) 16.50%



Based on the precedent results which hypothesis can we confirm and which one can we reject? 

- we can accept the first: 

- We partially accept the second (in our results the algorithm only skews the distribution upwards and does not hollow out the middle).




# IV) Limitations of the study:  

The study unfortunately lacked a non negligeable amount of real historical data. A lot of schools coulsnt by law publish their data as some classes were simply too small, which could have had some drawbacks in terms of the privacy of the concerned studenst, who would have likely been recognized in their results. This eventually forced us to resort us to use an abundant amount of proxy data, whihc we adapted to observations and precent studies 

For instance the overprediction and underprediction of grades were based in the assumptions made by former studies (quote study) were it was assumed that ojn average teachers tended to over predicted thei won students grades by 20 to 40% higher compeared to what they would iodeally score at the exam.


# V) Implications and suggestions for further research:


Despite some partial limitations till found how the algorithm indeed tends to be biased towards private schools. This is problematic because this... 

> Implications 

Immorality  1 : we cant stigmatise the performance of one student and its leavel of dedication to study based on the environement in which he has was raised. This would jeopardize the idea of meritocracy (which is already widely put into question)

Immmorality 2 : This system stromgly favors a reproduction of the elites and further enhances the class homogeneoty in each schools as parents who have teh necessary fiancnail capaqbilities will make everything in their power to bring their children in elite private schools.
